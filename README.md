# Simple2D

A simple engine I'm making for learning porpuses.

Everything in the subfolder "Simple2DEngine" contains the actual engine 
while "Simple2DgLibs" contains libraries for creating game objects.

## Dependencies
SDL2 GLEW GLU OpenGL lua stbi 

It's easiest to install them via your distros
package manager (windows user good luck have fun)
